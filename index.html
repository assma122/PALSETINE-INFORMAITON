    <h2>PALESTINE</h2>

    <p>
        Palestine is sometimes called the Holy Land.
        It is a sacred place for three major religions: Judaism, 
        Christianity, and Islam. Palestine is important to Jews 
        because the ancient kingdom of Israel was located there.
        Jews believe that God promised the land to them.
